I am a **final-year M.Sc. student** in **Computer Science and Engineering** at **Brac University**, Dhaka, Bangladesh, and a **full-time Graduate Research Assistant (GRA)**. My research focuses on developing **deep learning models** for **real-time image and video analysis**, with recent efforts directed at **multimodal AI**, particularly integrating **visual features** with **textual descriptions** to improve tasks like *image captioning* and *visual question answering*.

I have published work in **Q1 journals** and presented at numerous **conferences**. Previously, as a **Software Engineer Trainee** at **Medina Tech Ltd.**, I contributed to developing **machine learning models** for agriculture and location-based data analysis.

Outside of research, I have worked on several **AI projects**, including **RAG**, **LLM**, and **OCR**, driven by personal interest and competition, pushing the boundaries of **deep learning** and **computer vision**. In my personal time, I enjoy *swimming*, *running*, and *reading*, maintaining a balance between intellectual rigor and personal growth.

<!-- I am a final-year M.Sc. student in Computer Science and Engineering at Brac University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, working on my thesis and expected to finish by this year. I am also a full-time Graduate Research Assistant (GRA). My research primarily focuses on developing and optimizing deep learning models for real-time image and video analysis.

Recently, I have started developing models that integrate visual features from images with textual descriptions, aiming to improve tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. My work explores how these models can better understand and generate meaningful relationships between various data types, advancing the capabilities of multimodal AI systems.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer Trainee at Medina Tech Ltd., contributing to the development of machine learning models for agriculture and location-based data analysis. I have participated in various machine learning competitions and have published work in conferences and journals related to AI and deep learning.

Beyond my academic work, I actively engage in machine learning competitions and contribute to AI-driven projects in computer vision and natural language processing. I enjoy collaborating on open-source software and am always exploring new advancements in deep learning and multimodal systems. Outside of research, I enjoy swimming, running, and reading. -->
