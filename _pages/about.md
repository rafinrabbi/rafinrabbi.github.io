🧠 I'm a Research Assistant and graduate student at **Brac University**, deeply engaged in **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Multimodal AI**.

🔬 My current research focuses on **vision-language models for real-time crime prediction**, as part of my MSc thesis.

💻 I also love building real-world applications—from fall detection systems to digital farming tools—and exploring the frontier of intelligent systems.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Research and Projects
I'm currently working as a **Research Assistant** at Brac University where I:
- Design deep learning models for real-time image/video analysis.
- Work on edge-based video analytics using Jetson Orin Nano.
- Lead projects like **Fall Detection for Elderly People**, funded by the 2024 Research Seed Grant.

Previously, I also contributed to:
- **Dr. Chashi**, a real-time plant disease detection app using computer vision.
- Research on wildfire prediction, deepfake detection, and spiking neural networks.

## 💼 Industry Experience
I gained hands-on engineering experience at:
- **Medina Tech Ltd.** as a Software Engineer (AI/ML), where I optimized ML models, managed servers, and built data pipelines.
- **Master Wizr (Norway)** as a QA Automation Tester using Selenium and Postman.

## 📜 Publications
I've co-authored several papers in IEEE conferences and submitted work to journals like **Scientific Reports** and **Heliyon**.

Some selected contributions:
- 📝 [Lightweight CNNs for Plant Pathology](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCME57830.2023.10252315)
- 🧯 Wildfire Prediction using Kolmogorov‑Arnold Networks
- 🧠 Spiking Neural Networks for Efficient Image Classification

## 👨🏻‍🏫 Teaching and Outreach
- Taught as a **Student Tutor** in Data Structures and Algorithms at Brac University.
- Directed the **Robotics Club of BRAC University**, organizing workshops, financial planning, and events.
- Led robotics workshops focused on Arduino, circuits, and sensor integration.
