### Overview
**AgriBuddy** is a multilingual, AI-powered support platform designed to provide personalized agricultural guidance to **smallholder farmers in Bangladesh**.  
The project was developed during the **BRAC AI Hackathon (AgriBRAICution)**, combining **computer vision**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and a **smart chatbot** to help farmers with crop disease detection, weather insights, and cultivation tips.

### Key Contributions
- **Disease Detection:** Implemented a CNN-based rice disease detector trained on the **Paddy Doctor dataset**, enabling real-time classification of 10 rice conditions.  
- **Smart Chatbot:** Integrated an **agentic RAG framework** using **Bangla embeddings** to deliver context-aware, localized answers in Bengali.  
- **PWA Development:** Designed a **Progressive Web App** with offline support, combining **weather forecasts**, **soil analysis**, and personalized **cultivation guidance**.  
- **Team Collaboration:** Worked with a multidisciplinary team spanning **BRAC University, BUET, and DIU**; co-authored a technical report and presented results publicly.

### Tech & Tools
- **Deep Learning (CNNs)** for crop disease detection  
- **LangChain + RAG** for chatbot integration  
- **Bangla Embeddings** for language support  
- **PWA stack**: React · Node.js · IndexedDB for offline mode  
- **Cloud deployment** for real-time data access and scalability  

### Impact
- Brings **accessible AI guidance** to smallholder farmers in Bangladesh.
