### Overview
I lead the development of a real‑time **fall detection** and **daily‑activity recognition** system to improve safety and quality of life for independently living older adults.

### What I built
- Designed a real‑time video analytics pipeline for **fall detection** with low latency and high recall.
- Created a **custom dataset** of falls and daily activities; used **pose estimation** + ML to boost detection accuracy.
- Deployed **edge inference** on **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** for on‑device processing and immediate **cloud‑based alerts** to caregivers.

### Tech & Methods
- PyTorch · TensorRT · OpenCV · Pose Estimation · HAR models · ONNX · Jetson Orin Nano
- MLOps for dataset versioning, evaluation, and model iteration

### Impact
- Enables **immediate alerts** with privacy‑preserving, on‑device processing.
- Architecture designed for **24/7** monitoring and **scalable** caregiver dashboards.
